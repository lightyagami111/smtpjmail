/*
 * Using the SMTP Program
 *
 * To use the program in Listing 1.2, you must know the address of an SMTP
 * server usually provided by your ISP. If you are unsure of your SMTP server,
 * you should contact your ISP's customer service. In order for outbound e-mail
 * messages to be sent, your e-mail program must have this address. Once it
 * does, you can enter who is sending the e-mail (if you are sending it, you
 * would type your e-mail address in) and who will be on the receiving end. This
 * is usually entered under the Reply To field of your e-mail program. Both of
 * these addresses must be valid. If they are invalid, the e-mail may not be
 * sent. After you have entered these addresses, you should continue by entering
 * the subject, writing the actual message, and then clicking send. Note
 *
 * For more information on how to compile examples in this book, see Appendix E
 * 'How to Compile Examples Under Windows.'
 *
 * As stated earlier, to send an e-mail with this program, you must enter who is
 * sending the message. You may be thinking that you could enter any e-mail
 * address you want here, right? Yes, this is true; as long as the SMTP server
 * allows it, this program will allow you to impersonate anyone you enter into
 * the To address field. However, as previously stated, a savvy Internet user
 * can tell whether the e-mail address is fake.
 *
 * After the mention of possible misrepresentation of identity on the sender's
 * end, you may now be asking yourself, Is this program dangerous? This
 * program is no more dangerous than any e-mail client (such as Microsoft
 * Outlook Express or Eudora) that also requires you to tell it who you are. In
 * general, all e-mail programs must request both your identity and that of the
 * SMTP server. Examining the SMTP Server
 *
 * You will now be shown how this program works. We will begin by looking at how
 * a client socket is created. When the client socket is first instantiated, you
 * must specify two parameters. First, you must specify the host to connect to;
 * second, you must specify the port number (e.g., 80) you would like to connect
 * on. These two items are generally passed into the constructor. The following
 * line of code (from Listing 1.2) accomplishes this:
 *
 * java.net.Socket s =new java.net.Socket( _smtp.getText(),25 );
 *
 * This line of code creates a new socket, named s. The first parameter to the
 * constructor, _smtp .getText(), specifies the address to connect to. Here it
 * is being read directly from a text field. The second parameter specifies the
 * port to connect to. (The port for SMTP is 25.) Table 1.1 shows a listing of
 * the ports associated with most Internet services. The hostname is retrieved
 * from the _smtp class level variable, which is the JTextField control that the
 * SMTP hostname is entered into.
 *
 * If any errors occur while you are making the connection to the specified
 * host, the Socket constructor will throw an IOException. Once this connection
 * is made, input and output streams are obtained from the Socket.getInputStream
 * and Socket.getOutputStream methods. This is done with the following lines of
 * code from Listing 1.2:
 *
 * _out = new java.io.PrintWriter(s.getOutputStream());
 * _in = new java.io.BufferedReader(new java.io.InputStreamReader(s.getInputStream()));
 *
 * These low-level stream types are only capable of reading binary data. Because
 * this data is needed in text format, filters are used to wrap the lower-level
 * input and output streams obtained from the socket.
 *
 * In the code above, the output stream has been wrapped in a PrintWriter
 * object. This is because PrintWriter allows the program to output text to the
 * socket in a similar manner to the way an application would write data to the
 * System.out object by using the print and println methods. The application
 * presented here uses the println method to send commands to the SMTP server.
 * As you can see in the code, the InputStream object has also been wrapped; in
 * this case, it has been wrapped in a BufferedReader. Before this could happen,
 * however, this object must first have been wrapped in an InputStreamReader
 * object as shown here:
 *
 * _in = new java.io.BufferedReader(new
 * java.io.InputStreamReader(s.getInputStream()));
 *
 * This is done because the BufferedReader object provides reads that are made
 * up of lines of text instead of individual bytes. This way, the program can
 * read text up to a carriage return without having to parse the individual
 * characters. This is done with the readLine method.
 *
 * You will now be shown how each command is sent to the SMTP server. Each of
 * these commands that is sent results in a response being issued from the SMTP
 * server. For the protocol to work correctly, each response must be read by the
 * SMTP client program. These responses start with a number and then they give a
 * textual description of what the result was. A full-featured SMTP client
 * should examine these codes and ensure that no error has occurred.
 *
 * For the purposes of the SendMail example, we will simple ignore these
 * responses because most are informational and not needed. Instead, for our
 * purposes, the response will be read in and displayed to the _output list box.
 * Commands that have been sent to the server are displayed in this list with a
 * C: prefix to indicate that they are from the client. Responses returned from
 * the SMTP server will be displayed with the S: prefix.
 *
 * To accomplish this, the example program will use the send method. The send
 * method accepts a single String parameter to indicate the SMTP command to be
 * issued. Once this command is sent, the send method awaits a response from the
 * SMTP host. The portion of Listing 1.2 that contains the send method is
 * displayed here:
 *
 * protected void send(String s) throws java.io.IOException {
        // Send the SMTP command
         if(s!=null) {
         _model.addElement("C:"+s);
         _out.println(s);
        _out.flush(); }
       // Wait for the response
         String line = _in.readLine();
        if(line!=null) {
       _model.addElement("S:"+line);
       }
 }
 *
 * As you can see, the send method does not handle the exceptions that might
 * occur from its commands. Instead, they are thrown to the calling method as
 * indicated by the throws clause of the function declaration. The variable s is
 * checked to see if it is null. If s is null, then no command is to be sent and
 * only a response is sought. If s is not null, then the value of s is logged
 * and then sent to the socket. After this happens, the flush command is given
 * to the socket to ensure that the command was actually sent and not just
 * buffered. Once the command is sent, the readLine method is called to await
 * the response from the server. If a response is sent, then it is logged.
 *
 * Once the socket is created and the input and output objects are created, the
 * SMTP session can begin. The following commands manage the entire SMTP
 * session:
 *
 * send(null);
 * send("HELO " + java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName() );
 * send("MAIL FROM: " + _from.getText() ); send("RCPT TO: " + _to.getText() );
 * send("DATA");
 * _out.println("Subject:" + _subject.getText()); _out.println(
 * _body.getText() ); send("."); s.close();
 *
 * Tip
 *
 * Refer to Table 1.4 in the preceding section to review the details of what
 * each of the SMTP commands actually means.
 *
 * The rest of the SendMail program (as seen in Listing 1.2) is a typical Swing
 * application. The graphical user interface (GUI) layout for this application
 * was created using VisualCaf?. The VisualCaf? comments have been left in to
 * allow the form's GUI layout to be edited by VisualCaf? if you are using it.
 * If you are using an environment other than VisualCaf?, you may safely delete
 * the VisualCaf? comments (lines starting in //). The VisualCaf? code only
 * consists of comments and does not need to be deleted to run on other
 * platforms.
